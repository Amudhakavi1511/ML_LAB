# Linear Regression Analysis

This project presents a complete walkthrough of a **Linear Regression** model using real-world data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Objective

To build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to understand relationships between independent variables and a continuous target variable.

##  Features Covered

- Data Loading & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation heatmaps & feature insights  
- Splitting data into train/test sets  
- Model training using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`  
- Evaluation using metrics like RÂ², MAE, MSE  
- Residual analysis & scatter plots  
- Prediction on test data  

##  Libraries Used
